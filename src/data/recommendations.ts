    text: "I like Thiago's commitment. Only a few professional has such commitment and devotion. Thiago and I started talking because he asked me for some help with his CV, and in the end, we worked together for a few weeks. He started helping me with a personal project for free to learn, and due to his excellent performance converting designs into code, he became a paid freelancer and got more responsibilities in the project. He is definitely a developer with a brilliant future. I would love to work with him again someday.",

Your organization and communication are exceptional, and have helped a lot on all projects. He always shows care for them, and tries to understand everything in the best way, in order to be able to communicate even something that we had not seen. His role is indispensable in a Scrum team, not only for his role, but also for his empathy, humility and understanding.",

He is proactive, a programmer who insists on the search for problem solving, also with those with more complicated tasks, which can take a long time. He is a very communicative person, without problems with this and other soft-skills, trying to understand how the team is progressing, suggesting improvements and helping those who need it. I highly recommend him, he is an excellent professional.",
